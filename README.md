## About Project Hope

Project Hope is our way of connecting to kids with autism in a way that is helpful to them. On this platform, children will be able to: 

* 📚Read along with, or have the book read to them
* 🗣Talk to our chatbot so they can see how to respond
* 😡Learn a positive way to express emotions 
* 🎸Express themselves with music and dance
* 🎧Learn through repetitive songs 

These are just the start of what they can do but soon we will like to add:

* 📝Allowing the child to trace
* 📓Aloowing the children to have even more opportunities to learn

## To see the current design for the app

Since we have a team member that is experiencing their first hackathon, we do not have a fully functioning website running. We do however plan to add more in the future because we feel as though this app can change lives.
